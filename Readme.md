## Installation steps 
* Refer the quick link [here](https://developers.google.com/drive/api/quickstart/python) for setup

    * In can read files only those that are shared with the service account. 
    * It cannot delete from drive, due to permission issues ( Tried all could not get )

* SCOPES are important if you want to read metadata only / file only / Delete files etc.
* Apart from the files mentioned, we would eventually need credential(from the google oauth/token(generated after first usage) or Serviceaccount(google IAM) json files for this to work correctly
